It manages centralized master data that is critical to the operation and integration of all other modules. This ensures consistency, accuracy, and integrity of key operational data. Key objects The Core Module provides master data management for the following entities: Location management Equipment management Material management Shift management Configuration & settings 1. Location management Locations represent physical or logical areas within the production environment, such as production lines, storage areas, or quality labs. 2. Equipment management Equipment entities define the machines, tools, or systems used in manufacturing. Equipment Classes group similar types of equipment for categorization and configuration purposes. 3. Material Classes Material Classes are used to define groups of materials that share common characteristics or behaviors in the system. Materials define the material codes that are known within the company. Material batch define a batch of a specific materials Integration The Core is designed to integrate seamlessly with other modules in the manufacturing suite, including: Order cockpit Quality Management Downtimes ...
